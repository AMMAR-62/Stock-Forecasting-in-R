# Stock-Forecasting-in-R
 - stock forecasting in R using the yahoo finance data.
 - this is the financial technologies project.
 - I did it with the group:
    - Shubham Pawar (191080071).
    - Nityansh Doshi (191080053).
    - Sahil Satpute (191080066).
    - Atharva Bhosale (191080006).
 - We used the ARIMA model for by converting the xts/zoo data to monthly time series data.
 - We used exponential time smoothing, for obtaining a smooth graph.
 - We compared it with the linear regression prediction.
 - A shiny app is created which shows both the graph predictions in ARIMA and linear regression model.
 - the requirements of this project specified in requirements.txt
 - We also output the RMSE and percentage error in the data.
